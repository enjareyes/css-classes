/*
We added float: left to the .sidebar. 
.sidebar is moved all the way to the left of its parent container/the page. 
For this one, it doesn't look much different than where it was before, 
because it was already on the left. Second, it is now only as wide as its 
contentâ€”but it's still display: block, just a floated block element!

Now the other block elements act as if .sidebar has magically vanished. 
Imagine that .sidebar is now on a z-index, like it's floating closer to you, 
a level above all the block elements. .content is like, "what sidebar? 
we don't have a sidebar on this webpage!". .content is now appearing where it 
would be if there actually was no sidebar at all.
